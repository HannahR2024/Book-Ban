Our goal is to give students access to books that have been banned in their school district in order to allow them to explore their interests and not be limited by school censorship. With the recent book bans in America, many school districts have restricted certain books to students that talk about subject matters including religion, politics, race, sexuality, and diversity. Censoring these books puts limitations on what they can learn, and their freedom to explore their interests. This is why we created Got Bans, to give students freedom to read and an accessible way to find books they are interested in.

  <p class="intro">
 By far, the state with the most book bans is Texas, coming in at 1,648 banned books. That's a lot. We belive in anyone anywhere having access to these books that the author wrote and intended to be public. While we know that this can be a touchy subject, expesially regarding the area of kids, we belive that it is up to the parents and the person. Not the school district.
